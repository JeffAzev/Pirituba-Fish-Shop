                At the very heart of Dublin, there is a part of Brazil to be found and enjoyed – Pirituba Fish Shop. 
                Established by a Brazilian expatriate Carlos, this small shop has become his legacy and a manifestation of his love for fish.<br><br> 
                Located in a secluded corner, “Pirituba Fish Shop” is a mix of scents and colors. Freshly delivered fish, hand-picked, and ordered with love 
                by Carlos, each sold species smells of another journey and another meal waiting to be served. 
                From fat and juicy prawns to soft and enviably sweet cod, each fish carries the taste of two intertwined destinies from Brazil and Ireland, 
                the chef’s and entrepreneur’s zealous devotion and love.

            <p>"Absolutely love Pirituba Fish Shop! It's my little taste of Brazil right here in Dublin. 
                Carlos, the owner, is such a gem, always making me feel at home. 
                The fresh seafood they offer is top-notch, and every visit feels like a mini getaway to Brazil. 
                So grateful to have this spot in town!"
